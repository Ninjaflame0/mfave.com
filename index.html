    <h1> Minecraft
    </h1>
    <p> Minecraft is an amzing game, play it every day and why I love this game. This is a sandbox game but with many other things. Like it has a survival mode wherer you have to survive and gather resources and beat the enderdragon to beat the game, but It is an infinite game so they is more to do, like create huge building or create farms. To add to that they is a creative mode where you can build toyour hearts content. And they is multiplayer in both modes to play with your friends which adds more fun you can play with anyone, it is simple to play, but hard to master. But they is also servers you can play with many modes and minigames games like bedwars or skywars in hypixel, They isnt only one server, like they is cubecreaft and that you can find.
